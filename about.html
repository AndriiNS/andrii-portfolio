                  With my level of English, I can watch movies and TV shows and understand most of the words I hear from native speakers. That means I
                  can have a job interview in this language. The level of writing and grammar is slightly worse than speaking and listening. I can
                  know and pronounce some words correctly, but I don't know how to spell them. So to summarize, my level of English is between B2 and
                  C1

                  I am a very sociable and open-minded person who is not afraid to defend my opinion. Because I have performed so much over the 13
                  years of my career as a dancer, I am not afraid of people at all and can talk to them easily. I am not afraid to make new friends
                  and I am not afraid of changes in my life. Of course, stability is very good, but I always want to move to the best. I am also a
                  stubborn person, if I come up with an idea or start arguing with someone, I will do my best to see it through.

                  I started working in an online store as a content manager. I uploaded products to the site through the admin panel. I worked in this
                  position for about 1 year, when the products ran out, I had nothing to do there. Then I started learning front-end and in 1-2 years
                  I was already making websites for my friends and acquaintances. Now I work for a company that deals with business school and make
                  advertising landing pages for them, you can see them in my projects. But I work part-time, so my salary is low. Now I am looking for
                  a professional company where I can develop.

                  Feedback is very important to me, because I can't always see my mistakes, and when there is a team or people checking the result,
                  it's much easier to work. I don't send the result to the client if I don't like it. All my work was closed with minimal edits. But
                  once I had a client who didn't know what he wanted. He asked me to redesign the same block several times, and he didn't like it. It
                  wasn't a designer's mistake or my mistake, but the client wanted this block to have a completely different design. So I agreed with
                  him that I would charge for each additional hour of work and soon finished this project
